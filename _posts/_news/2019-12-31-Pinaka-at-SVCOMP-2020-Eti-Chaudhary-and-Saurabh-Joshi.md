##### **Pinaka at SVCOMP 2020!**

SVCOMP is a Software Verification COMPetition which is the ultimate battleground for researchers around the world to prove the mettle of their verifiers on more than 10000 benchmark programs.

Pinaka, a symbolic execution engine designed and developed at IIT Hyderabad, participated and performed quite well at SVCOMP 2020. Team Pinaka, consisting of Eti Chaudhary and [Saurabh Joshi](https://sbjoshi.github.io), was the only participating team from Indian Academia last year at SVCOMP 2019 and was placed 2nd in ReachSafety-Floats subcategory.

This year at SVCOMP 2020, Pinaka was placed 3rd in ReachSafety-Floats subcategory, 8th in ReachSafety category and 6th in Termination category. Pinaka was the fastest verifier in ReachSafety and Termination category whenever it produced an answer. It was also one of the most accurate verifiers with only 3 errors in more than 6500 benchmarks it was run on.

This year, Akash Banerjee, Eti Chaudhary and [Saurabh Joshi](https://sbjoshi.github.io) were part of team Pinaka.
